## Introduction

This project is focused on analyzing the student-faculty ratio and class size in a school or university. The student-faculty ratio is the number of students divided by the number of teachers, while class size refers to the number of students a teacher faces during a given period of instruction. In this project, we analyze the student-teacher ratio and average class size of the Math department and compare it to the rest of the departments.

## Methods

The student-teacher ratio is obtained by dividing the number of full-time equivalent pupils by the number of full-time equivalent teachers. The average class size is defined as the proportion of all enrolled students to a particular department's classes and the number of teachers in that department. The analysis was performed using a sample of students and teachers, and the data was then used to determine the average class size (ACS) distribution for the Math department.

## Results
The ACS distribution for the Math department was found to be non-normal. The graph was bimodal and not symmetric, which raised questions about the reason for the non-normal distribution.

Several reasons were identified for the non-normal distribution:

Each student has different probability weights, as each student decides for themselves how many courses to take in a given term.
Professors can teach in multiple departments, leading to confusion in estimating the average ACS.
Some subjects can be offered in two different departments, leading to over-estimation of the average ACS.
The proportion of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in courses can differ greatly, affecting the average value of ACS.

## Conclusion
The mean ACS distribution was assumed to approximately equal the average ACS for the Math department. However, based on the estimated z-score of the average ACS for all other departments, the null hypothesis (that the mean of the distribution is equal to the average ACS Math value) could not be rejected.

It was concluded that if the mean of the distribution is not assumed to be equal to the average ACS Math value, it is not possible to make any conclusions about the null hypothesis.
